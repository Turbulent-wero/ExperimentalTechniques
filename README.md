# ExperimentalTechniques
Repository for reports about Hot Wire and PIV practices

Here we can storage all the files regarding to the practices of Hot Wire and PIV (plots, LaTex, PDF's,etc)

I will create folders and subfolders for both practices with info regarding every single experiment we did.


I think it is not necessary to include all the files we have in your USB, only the ones we are going to work with:
  - HWA:
    - Excel file for the last week 
    - Calibration measures at the beggining and the end of the last day of HWA
    - Measurements of the last day of HWA
  
  - PIV:
    - Folders with angle0 and angleX info 
      - Velocity fields 
      - Plots 
      - Vorticity 
      - Scalar variables screenshots
